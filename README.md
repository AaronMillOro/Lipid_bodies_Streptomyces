# Lipid_bodies_Streptomyces
Contains the script for analysis of protein abundances presents in lipid bodies of Streptomyces samples. 
Data was generated by LC-MS/MS and quantification is based on Spectral counting (MS2). 

## Description of the pipeline

* Imports data obtained from the proteins identification search engine X!TandemPipeline (http://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/xtandempipeline/)
* Generates metadata containing experimental conditions and replicates
* Generates a dataframe structure containing abundances and metadata informations
* Filters of proteins showing low ratio between conditions
* Performes a Global Linear Model (GLM) and multiple ANOVA tests to determine the statistically significant proteins among the different conditons
* Exports Spectral Counting data as CSV file
* Generates box plots of proteins with statistically significant variation
* Performs Principal components analysis (PCA) and Heatmap plots
